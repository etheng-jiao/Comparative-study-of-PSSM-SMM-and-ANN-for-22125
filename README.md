 We explored 3 methods' performance for MHC I binding prediction. In this process, we used the nest cross validation to train and evaluate SMM and ANN. And then we used 3 metrics, RMSE, AUC and Accuracy, to evaluate which method is the best one. Finally, we made a robustness test to check if the 3 methids are sensitive to distribution of target and metrics.
